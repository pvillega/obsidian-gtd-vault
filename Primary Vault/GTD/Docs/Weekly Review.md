Steps for the weekly review

## Get Clear 

- Gather letters, notes, and other physical material that needs processing
- Add into entry note in obsidian any subjects floating around the mind, concerns we have, etc
- Process everything: material gathered, email inbox, entry note in Obsidian

## Get Current 

- Review Waiting For list for required follow ups (add action)
- Review past week Calendar for any action we forgot to gather
- Review next two weeks in Calendar, ensure all items should be there (they shouldn't be in the inbox)
- Review Next action list and mark and remove completed actions
- Ensure all actions in Next Action list can be completed next week. Any that can't move to "Some Day Actions". Actions must be 'actionable', well defined.
- Review project lists, ensure they all have at least 1 action for next week. Any actions that can't be completed, leave as non-action (for later). Actions must be 'actionable', well defined. Close completed projects.
- Review your [[Goals]] note, ensure all current projects and actions are aligned with them. Whatever doesn't align, move to 'Some day' or delete.

## Get Creative

- Review "Some Day Actions" and move any that should happen next week to the proper place
- Review "Some Day Projects" and move any that should be active to the Active projects list. Try to only do so when we close a current project (capacity limits). The new project must have an action
- Delete any long-term actions and projects that we are not interested on doing anymore, or have become unrealistic



Ensure your lists and contexts have hard edges, if it is hard to decide where something goes, you may need to revisit that list or context.

During the review it is a good idea to go over a trigger list, a list of words with key words/actions of things we may have missed, and have not been added to the Inbox. See: 

Boss, project pending, project started, home tasks, pets, kids, company, banks, cash, accounting, legal, residence, flat, rent, parents, health, exercise, food, shopping, sex, weather, trips, events, meetups, anniversaries, work, consulting, tech, games, books, german, learning, free time, life objectives, stress, notes, obsidian, other
