## What is it

GTD aim is to make you have 100% trust in a system for collecting tasks, ideas, and projects. From small and concrete (call X on Sunday) to big ideas (become rich)

A key concept is to convert both tasks and whims into _physical_ and _visible_ **actions**

## What do you need

You need a calendar where you can keep time sensitive tasks and events

You also need the following lists:
1.  Inbox (In)
2.  Next actions (probably several)
3.  Waiting for
4.  Projects
5.  Some day/maybe

## Inbox (In list)

An area where you write down both ideas and tasks as they happen. It needs to be low friction, so that it is easy to add to it.

The main point of the list is to offload things from the brain, into a known and reliable area. Not scattered across 20 apps or papers.

### Processing the inbox

You want to process the inbox regularly. It should be done in order, as things appear in the list. 

The question to ask first is: It is actionable? If the answer is not, then there are several options:
- no longer needed: delete it
- relevant for the future: keep it as reference material in Obsidian
- future plans: add it to the `Some day` list
- needs review later: incubate it (sit on it for a while), add it to a secondary  file for review on the next weekly planning

If it is actionable, ask: what is the next action? This has to be a defined, physical, and defined action. Not "plan this" but "email that person"
This is key, we need to write done things that are actionable, so we can always chose one action and do it, not spend time pre-processing.

Once the action is determined, there are several options:
- If it takes les than 5 minutes, do it immediately and close the action
- If it takes longer:
    - Delegate it and add it to a `Waiting For` list
    - Add it to the `Next actions` list
    - If this is likely to cause a series of actions, the overall goal and the action should be added to a `Project` list

## Next actions

The `Next actions` list is, literally, a list of actions to be done as soon as possible. The place to go when we have time to do something.

## Waiting For

This list shows actions that are blocked, as we wait for someone else. Entries should have a date associated, so we know how long we have been waiting

## Projects

A project is anything that requires more than one action to be completed. 
The `Projects` lists should contain project titles, descriptions, and desired outcomes.

On review, we must make sure that for every project there is an entry in the `Next Actions` list. If there is not, we need to add the next task, or close the project if completed (goal achieved)

## Contexts

Contexts are tags added to tasks so that we now if an action can take place where we are. The value is to understand what can be done where: home, shop, office, or anywhere. 

It can also be useful to have contexts for regular events, like regular meetings with someone.

## Some day/Maybe

This list simply contains ideas and projects that may happen sometime in the future, but don't need to go into the `Next actions` yet, nor is that an active project.

## Calendar

Calendar is only for things you **have to do**. Not `I should do this around this date`. Those go to either `Next actions` or `Some day` depending on how we process them in the `Inbox`. 

This is important as that marks the daily events that block time of your day. The actions that can't be moved: doctor appointment, anniversary, etc.

## Weekly review

This is a critical process for the success of GTD. It helps ensuring the other bits work as intended, and reduces time spent on admin daily. Should take around 30 minutes at most, once per week. See [[Weekly Review]].

The idea behind that is to ensure we have dumped all the `open loops` in our brain to the inbox list.
