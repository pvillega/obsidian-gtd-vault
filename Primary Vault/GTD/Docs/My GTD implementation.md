## Plugins used

### Core plugins 

The following core plugins are installed:

Backlinks: so that we can navigate between linked notes. Not ticked the option to show them in the notes

Command Palette: to pin actions at the top of the command palette for easy access

File Recovery: disaster recovery, keeps changes for 7 days in case we edit the wrong thing

Note Composer: allows extracting text from a note to another, or to merge notes

Page Preview: so we can preview content when hovering a link

### Community plugins

Advanced Tables: facilitates working with tables in markdown, includes some formula capability.

Advanced URI: provides endpoints to allow external tools to do actions in Obsidian, like edit a note, open a note, etc.

Calendar: enables a calendar view to navigate between daily and periodic notes. Dependency of other plugins

Dataview: turns all notes in the vault into a database that can be queried. Ideal to extract information and merge page content dynamically.

Find orphaned files and broken links: helps with keeping the knowledge vault organised

Natural language dates: allows adding dates with expressions like `@today`. Dependency of other plugins

Omnisearch: better search plugin that builds a decent search database. Necessary to navigate the knowledge base.

Periodic notes: allows the creation of daily, weekly, quarterly, and annual notes via templates. Key to schedule the daily tasks.

Tag Wrangler: adds a context menu for tags in theÂ Obsidian.md tag pane that helps managing tags, detect diverging tags due to typos, etc.

Tasks: allows tracking of tasks in a simple way. Enables recurring tasks and other enhancements, which reduce the need for Templater and Dataview hacks.

Templater: provides some tools to insert variables and functions in templates. They run just once, though. Used to load data from calendars into the daily note.

## Folder organisation and templates

The folder `GTD` contains the GTD content. Folder `Meta` contains various meta information like daily notes, templates, and similar. The folder `Docs` contains documentation relevant to GTD

## Use of tags

I use tags to classify tasks. For example, `Waiting For`  is not a file but a collection of all tasks tagged as #waiting  This allows me to keep tasks inside a project (if relevant) but understand that they are in a particular status, and can be listed in the `Daily note` as `Waiting For` tasks

Valid tags are #waiting  #home  #shop etc

### Next Actions and Waiting For

`Next Actions` is lists of tasks to be done, added by using the GTD workflow. Those are tasks that don't belong to a project, and they have different value for the daily organisation regarding where to display them. The list, as per GTD principles, should be limited to tasks we want to achieve during the next week, not more. 

`Waiting For` is not a file, but is generated from tags associated to tasks.

Both are embedded in the `Daily Note` along any project tasks.

There is another file, `Recurring actions`, which contains recurring actions that happen regularly. Stuff like home tasks, regular checks of some bank accounts, etc. All recurring notes have an associated due date, so they will be pulled into the daily tasks.  These actions are split from the `Next Actions` note so that we avoid polluting the other note unnecessarily.

### Projects

We have a template `Project Template` that can be used to create a new project. It has a variable `isWork` that is used to hide work projects outside work hours, to facilitate focus.

Note that some projects may already have some 

### Daily note

A daily note is used to drive the actions of the day. It extracts data from multiple sources:
- Calendar 
- Actions in the GTD flow, both for active projects and for next tasks. Projects can be filtered out outside work hours, so that we focus on what matters.
- A list of any `Waiting For` actions at the bottom, for reference if we get a response

Please note that the Calendar view is populated via a script (via icalbuddy, see ~/Documents/ical.sh. Run manually until Obsidian fixes permissions), so it is not dynamic. 

The other views are populated using `DataView` and `Tasks`, so they are dynamic. This combination allows us to reduce the number of tasks we show per project, so that we reduce stress related to amount of work pending

The `Daily Note` note is intended to be pinned to a side of the dashboard, so we can see all daily tasks at a glance.

### Some Day

This folder contains projects that aren't currently active, but we may want to start some day in the future. 

Also contains an `Actions for Some Day` note where we can add future ideas that we may want to do later. Note that they are not marked as tasks, but single entries, to avoid them being pulled into the `Daily note` by mistake

### Next Week

A support note that lists all the tasks scheduled for the next week, so that we can keep it real when doing the weekly review in GTD
