#gtd-actions 

Global backlog, things to be extracted into tasks weekly. While some projects may have their own backlogs to limit work-in-progress during a week (things that need to be done next but not this week), this is more a mid-to-long term list. 


- a task that we will promote into next tasks during the weekly review
- another task with the same purpose
- this task may end up removed as we don't care about it
